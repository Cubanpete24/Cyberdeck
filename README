Hello! I'm committing this file to maintain my git commit streak. I will update this later!

Third day in a row just updating READMEs, cut me some slack I'm moving houses! !

I know you are probably tired of these lazy commits but I care about the streak baby. This is the first night I'm sleeping in the new house, tomorrow I hope ot have my desk and workstation setup but honestly? there's sooo much stuff to unpack

I finally have wifi at the new house!

Hey gamers! Still getting settled in after the move. Here's what the Cyberdeck is about

The Cyberdeck is a javascript web application that makes API calls to a Spring Application that manages a SQLite database. 

The goal for this app is to help Cyberpunk Red GMs facilitate their games with an "in universe" tool. 

The first phase of development involves persisting a database of player characters and NPCs (or toons). The user will be able to create, update, and delete toons. Creation will come in the same order as the book suggests for cohesion. 

The second phase of development will entail creating encounters. Inside these encounters we can track the initiatives of all the players, and NPCs they're facing. Inside this module. we will also track everyone's HP, ammo, and abilities that can only proc under certain conditions. 

The third phase of development (Although honestly this might be good to iron out before phase 2) will entail having multiple "users" connected to a single host server. Probably peer to peer. each user will be able to pull data from the shared SQLite db, and see data update in real time.
