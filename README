Hello! I'm committing this file to maintain my git commit streak. I will update this later!

Third day in a row just updating READMEs, cut me some slack I'm moving houses! 

Hey gamers! Still getting settled in after the move. Here's what the Cyberdeck is about

The Cyberdeck is a javascript web application that makes API calls to a Spring Application that manages a SQLite database. 

The goal for this app is to help Cyberpunk Red GMs facilitate their games with an "in universe" tool. 

The first phase of development involves persisting a database of player characters and NPCs (or toons). The user will be able to create, update, and delete toons. Creation will come in the same order as the book suggests for cohesion.
